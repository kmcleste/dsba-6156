## Docker

We have included some helper functions to build and run the docker image for you. Run the following:

```bash
make docker-build

Once the build is complete, docker should spin up a new container which hosts our Streamlit site. You can access the site by going to [localhost:8501](https://localhost:8501) in your browser.
